# Update-IP-File
This Python script automates the updating of an "allow_list.txt" file by removing specified IP addresses listed in a remove list. It opens the file, reads its contents, converts the IP addresses into a list, iterates through the remove list, removes matching IP addresses, updates the list, and writes the revised IP addresses back to the file.
